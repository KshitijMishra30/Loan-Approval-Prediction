# Loan Approval Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
A supervised machine-learning classification project that predicts whether a loan application is **Approved** or **Rejected** using applicant financial and profile attributes.

## Project workflow
- Loaded and inspected the loan-application dataset.
- Cleaned data, handled missing values, corrected data types and addressed invalid negative asset values.
- Encoded categorical variables and explored relationships between applicant attributes and loan status.
- Used exploratory analysis to study CIBIL score, income, loan amount, loan term and asset values.
- Applied feature scaling and a train/test split.
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluated it using accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report.
- Explored feature selection and probability-threshold adjustment.
- Included an unseen-record prediction example and a Gradio deployment section in the notebook.

## Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Joblib, Gradio.

## Dataset
The notebook expects `data/loan_approval_dataset.csv`. The dataset is not included. Place a copy of the source CSV in the `data/` folder and confirm its license permits redistribution before uploading it publicly.

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
Open `loan_approval_prediction.ipynb` and run cells in order.

## Notes
The notebook includes a model-export/deployment example. Review the model filename and feature preprocessing consistency before using it as a production application. Evaluation scores should be taken from the notebook's executed output, not assumed from this README.
